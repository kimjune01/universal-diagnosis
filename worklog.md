# Work Log

## 2026-03-20: Initial design session

Started exploring universal diagnosis as a cheap Attend alternative for agents. Key moves in the conversation:

1. **MCTS over a universal fault tree** — instead of blind-blind-merge (expensive portfolio solvers), use MCTS (implicit redundancy, same row in the Attend grid). The Natural Framework's six roles provide a portable tree structure that works across domains.

2. **Two stacks per node** — every pipe has a cache stack (forward pass, 4 handoffs) and a consolidate stack (backward pass, 3 stages). First diagnostic question at any node is which stack, a cheap binary split.

3. **Recursive structure** — no privileged scales. Every node is a pipe, every pipe has the same shape, recurse until rock bottom (atomic operation). Sector/domain/function are metadata for priors, not structural layers.

4. **Trauma recurrence heuristic** — cheap consolidate probe. Instead of "is this system learning?" (expensive), ask "has this system repeated a known failure?" (cheap event matching). Works at every scale.

5. **Goal reframe** — the tool isn't the product, the predictions are. Generate falsifiable predictions from the framework, publish them, build a scorecard. Mendeleev play: legitimize the framework by predicting what others can't.

6. **Five prediction types**: recurrence, cascade, fix, death, mitosis. Mitosis is the novel one — a stack that outgrows its parent pipe must split into an independent pipe or starve the sibling stack.

7. **Biotech as pilot sector** — data is public (ClinicalTrials.gov, FDA, SEC), outcomes are documented, market prices predictions fast. Key framing: the molecule is the pipe, the company is its consolidate stack. The entire org chart maps onto Read → Process → Write.

8. **Coordination protocol** — marketing-speak as the common language between agents and humans. Node descriptions are human-readable sentences that double as lock names.

9. **Head-to-head with analysts** — biotech analysts are named, public, and trackable. The legitimacy play is timestamped predictions that contradict specific analysts, scored honestly. The framework's edge: process prediction (will the company iterate effectively?) vs. outcome prediction (will the drug work?).

10. **Quarterly catalyst calendar** — biotech has pre-scheduled events (earnings, PDUFA dates, trial readouts). Publish before the date, outcome is public within days. Fastest possible scorecard iteration.

## Methodology

### How to diagnose a biotech company

1. **Identify the molecule-as-pipe.** What compound is the company iterating on? What's the target, mechanism, indication? This is the forward pass — compound → binding → effect → outcome.

2. **Map the company to the consolidate stack.** Who reads outcomes (clinical ops, biostats)? Who processes them (R&D, med chem)? Who writes back to the substrate (manufacturing, formulation, regulatory)? Public sources: 10-K org descriptions, LinkedIn headcount by function, conference presentations.

3. **Run the stack-level probe.** Is the output wrong now (cache stack), or has it failed to improve over time (consolidate stack)? For biotech, "failed to improve" means: did the compound change meaningfully between trial iterations? Compare intervention descriptions on ClinicalTrials.gov across sequential trials.

4. **Check for trauma recurrence.** Find a known failure (trial miss, CRL, clinical hold). Check if the same class of failure recurred. Sources: FDA letters, trial results, SEC risk factor disclosures. `count(similar_failures) > 1` = broken consolidate.

5. **Classify the prediction type.**
   - Recurrence: same failure class will happen again (consolidate broken at batch process)
   - Cascade: too many similar candidates, one failure will correlate across pipeline (Filter → Attend handoff broken)
   - Fix: specific parts bin algorithm would address the gap
   - Death: multiple broken stages, loop can't self-correct
   - Mitosis: platform/infrastructure consuming disproportionate resources, will spin off or starve the pipeline

6. **Find the analyst consensus.** What are named analysts predicting for the same catalyst? Sources: analyst reports (sometimes paywalled), earnings call transcripts (free via SEC), financial media coverage, price targets.

7. **Publish the prediction.** Timestamped, with:
   - The framework's diagnosis (which stack, which stage, which type)
   - The specific falsifiable claim
   - The catalyst date (when the outcome will be known)
   - The analyst consensus or a named contrary position
   - The evidence trail (links to public sources)

8. **Score.** After the catalyst date, record the outcome. Framework right or wrong. Analyst right or wrong. Update the scorecard. Publish misses at the same prominence as hits.

### What "right" means

A prediction is confirmed when:
- **Recurrence**: the same failure class occurs again (same CRL reason, same endpoint miss, same safety signal)
- **Cascade**: multiple pipeline candidates fail on the same mechanism within the predicted timeframe
- **Fix**: the company implements the predicted fix and outcomes improve (harder to score — requires longer follow-up)
- **Death**: the company ceases meaningful R&D activity (runs out of cash, gets acquired for parts, pivots entirely)
- **Mitosis**: the platform/infrastructure becomes a separate business unit, spin-off, or is licensed independently

A prediction is refuted when the opposite occurs within the stated timeframe, or when the stated timeframe expires without the predicted event.

### What we're not predicting

- Whether the drug works (biology). That's the analyst's domain.
- Stock price. Price is downstream of many factors beyond the learning loop.
- Timing of regulatory decisions. FDA has its own pipe.

We're predicting whether the company's consolidate stack will produce a meaningfully different outcome next time. Process, not product.

## 2026-03-20: Tooling setup

### Target selection
Decided to go head-to-head with Martin Shkreli's public biotech positions from 2025-2026. He's a named analyst with timestamped, falsifiable calls — perfect for the scorecard.

**Shkreli's positions (seeded into DB):**
- CAPR (Capricor Therapeutics) — shorted, 46-page report, said HOPE-3 "will not work". Stock +440%. Admitted "bad call". → Run 0 retrospective.
- SPRB (Spruce Biosciences) — long, targets $500, BLA submission Q4 2026. → Run 1 forward.
- QURE (uniQure) — was long AMT-130, sold Nov 2025.
- ATYR (aTyr Pharma) — short, predicted 80% crash.
- INMB (Inmune Bio) — predicted 90% drop.

### Scripts and database
- `schema.sql` — relational schema: company, pipe (recursive tree), trauma, prediction, analyst_call, scorecard view. Embedding tables for pipe descriptions and trauma descriptions.
- `init_db.py` — creates DB, seeds 5 companies and 2 CAPR traumas.
- `embed.py` — embeds pipe/trauma descriptions using all-MiniLM-L6-v2. Includes `find_similar_traumas()` for recurrence probes via cosine similarity.
- `diagnose.py` — CLI for building pipe trees (`add_pipe`, `diagnose_pipe`), recording predictions (`add_prediction`), analyst calls (`add_analyst_call`), scoring (`score_prediction`), and displaying results (`tree TICKER`, `scorecard`).
- `prereg.md` — pre-registration for the biotech pilot.

All verified working. DB initialized with 5 companies, 2 traumas embedded, scorecard empty and waiting.

### Research protocol: semiblind-semiblind merge

The diagnosis research itself uses the framework's Attend step — diverse selection with redundancy control.

**Architecture**: 2×2 Claude subagents for search, 2 codex instances for merge.

**Search layer (4 Claude subagents, run in parallel):**

| Instance | Search angle | Primary data source |
|---|---|---|
| Cache-A | Forward pass probes: is the molecule's pipeline broken? | ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed |
| Cache-B | Forward pass probes: same angle, independent search | SEC EDGAR, financial media |
| Consolidate-A | Backward pass probes: is the company learning? | FDA letters, trial amendments |
| Consolidate-B | Backward pass probes: same angle, independent search | Conference presentations, analyst reports |

- **Semi-blind**: all agents share the framework vocabulary (six roles, two stacks, probe language) but don't see each other's findings during search.
- **Stochastic**: agents start from different data sources so they don't converge on the same evidence. The diversity is in the entry point, not the lens.
- **2 instances per angle**: if both Cache agents find the same evidence independently, it's high-confidence signal. If they diverge, the divergence itself is diagnostic.

**Attend (top-2 selection):**
- From the 4 agent outputs, select the top 2 based on evidence quality, novelty, and internal consistency.
- The other 2 are discarded — they served as diversity insurance during search. If they found nothing the top 2 missed, the search was thorough enough.

**Merge layer (2 codex instances, independent):**

| Instance | Input | Job |
|---|---|---|
| Codex-A | Top 2 agent outputs | Merge into single SOAP note with refs |
| Codex-B | Top 2 agent outputs | Same job, independent. Doesn't see Codex-A's output |

**SOAP note format:**
- **S** (Subjective): What the company/analysts say about themselves. Narrative from SEC filings, press releases, analyst reports.
- **O** (Objective): Hard data. Trial results, FDA letters, ClinicalTrials.gov entries, financial metrics.
- **A** (Assessment): Framework diagnosis. Which stack, which stage, which prediction type. How the evidence maps to the pipe tree.
- **P** (Plan): The falsifiable prediction. Claim, catalyst date, timeframe, analyst position for head-to-head.
- **Refs**: Links to all public sources cited.

- **Semi-blind merge**: both codex instances see the same top-2 evidence but judge independently. Agreement = high confidence. Disagreement = needs human judgment.

**Human Attend**: the user reads both SOAP notes, picks or synthesizes into the final published diagnosis. Skills automate Filter, human keeps Attend.

## 2026-03-20: Prereg tightening (codex sniff test #2)

Codex reviewed the actual prereg.md. Verdict: "Solid as a pilot operations plan. Weak as a true pre-registration." Key issues and how we addressed them:

1. **Prediction template must force binary resolution.** Added: every prediction must be PASS/FAIL on a specific catalyst within a specific window. If it can't be expressed this way, it's not ready to publish.

2. **"Analyst consensus" was undefined.** Replaced with: mechanical extraction of Shkreli's most recent public stance, mapped to bull/bear/neutral using fixed rules. One framework prediction vs. one analyst call. No consensus aggregation.

3. **Void bucket was dangerous.** Tightened: void only if catalyst is cancelled entirely. Delays are scored — window extends by one quarter, max one extension. Delays themselves are evidence for process predictions.

4. **Human merge was a leakage point.** Fixed: when codex instances disagree, human selects one (not synthesizes). Both are published. Selection committed before catalyst date.

5. **Run 0 was implicitly supporting accuracy claims.** Relabeled: "demonstration only." Does not count toward accuracy.

6. **Needed baselines beyond Shkreli.** Added: naive base rate (historical Phase 3 success rates from BIO/Informa) and always-pessimistic baseline. Primary endpoint for Run 1: beat pessimism.

7. **Target list was seeds, not frozen.** Frozen: Run 0 = CAPR, QURE. Run 1 = SPRB, ATYR, INMB. No additions or removals.

8. **Mixed outcomes unaddressed.** Added: prediction template requires specifying which endpoint determines resolution. Scored against that endpoint only.

9. **One prediction per catalyst rule.** Added: no stacking multiple predictions on the same company.

10. **Negativity bias.** Added as known bias #8, controlled by specificity requirement and always-pessimistic baseline.

11. **Downgraded success criterion.** Run 1 primary endpoint: framework accuracy > always-pessimistic baseline. At N=3, this means at least one correct PASS prediction.

12. **No special exemptions for biology.** If the drug fails for biological reasons, prediction still resolves as PASS or FAIL on the stated catalyst.

## 2026-03-20: Prereg tightening (codex sniff test #3)

Four final fixes:

1. **Merge tiebreak**: `soap-a` wins by default. No human selection.
2. **Dropped forced PASS**: if all predictions are FAIL, run is non-discriminating vs. pessimism. That's a result.
3. **Freeze point**: explicit commit after Run 0, before Run 1. Message: "Freeze: Run 0 complete, Run 1 locked."
4. **Per-company catalyst appendix**: locked exact catalyst, source, window, and PASS/FAIL conditions for all three Run 1 companies:
   - **SPRB**: BLA submission for TA-ERT, by 2026-12-31. PASS = submitted and accepted.
   - **ATYR**: FDA Type C meeting outcome for efzofitimod, by 2026-06-30. PASS = viable regulatory path confirmed. Note: Phase 3 already missed primary endpoint — this is about whether the company's consolidate stack can find a path from failure.
   - **INMB**: MAA submission to UK MHRA for CORDStrom, by 2026-09-30. PASS = submitted and acknowledged.

Also added explicit scope section and statistical posture (descriptive only, no inferential claims at N=3).

## 2026-03-20: CAPR search dispatched + temporal network insight

### CAPR search (4 agents dispatched)
Launched 4 parallel agents on CAPR per protocol. Cache-B returned first with excellent data from SEC EDGAR filings.

Cache-B key finding: the forward pass was **broken and rebuilt**, not patched. The original BLA (2024) tried to skip from HOPE-2 (n=20, Phase 2, cardiac subscore, natural history comparison) directly to approval. FDA rejected at Attend→Remember handoff (CRL: "did not meet substantial evidence of effectiveness"). Company then ran HOPE-3 (n=106, Phase 3, placebo-controlled, full PUL v2.0 primary + LVEF key secondary). Resubmission accepted, PDUFA August 22, 2026.

### Temporal network reframe (INVALIDATES static tree)

User's insight from Prof. Joseph Peters (SFU): our pipe tree is a temporal network, not a static tree. Peters' sequence-based dynamic graphs (Theory of Computing Systems, 2019) model exactly this — same node set, different edge states per time snapshot, with composition and test operations.

**What this changes:**
- The pipe tree topology (nodes = handoffs, roles) is stable across time
- The *states* (functional/broken/stressed/repaired) vary per snapshot
- The consolidate heuristic is a temporal connectivity test: does information propagate from failure at t₁ to repair at t₂?
- Schema updated: added `snapshot` and `pipe_state` tables, removed status/diagnosis from `pipe`

**CAPR as temporal graph (from Cache-B data):**

| Handoff | t₁ (HOPE-2/BLA era) | t₂ (HOPE-3 era) |
|---|---|---|
| Perceive → Cache | Functional | Stressed (two-facility split, CMC issues) |
| Cache → Filter | Functional | Functional (widened slightly) |
| Filter → Attend | Broken (subscore endpoint, n=20) | Repaired (PUL v2.0 total, n=106) |
| Attend → Remember | Broken (CRL, insufficient evidence) | Functional (PDUFA Aug 2026) |

Two handoffs were broken at t₁ and repaired at t₂. That's temporal connectivity — the consolidate stack propagated the failure signal backward and the forward pass was rebuilt. Framework would have predicted PASS on HOPE-3 because the consolidate stack was functional.

**Shkreli's error through this lens:** his 46-page short report analyzed the forward pass at t₁ ("the drug won't work") without checking whether the consolidate stack had repaired the broken handoffs by t₂. He diagnosed a snapshot, not a trajectory.

### CAPR search invalidated
The 4 agents were dispatched with the old static-tree framing. Their data is still useful as raw evidence, but the search reports need to be restructured as temporal sequences (pipe states across snapshots), not static handoff assessments. Will reformat when all agents return.

### All 4 agents returned

**Top 2 selected for merge (per protocol):**

1. **Consolidate-A** (strongest): Four-snapshot temporal sequence (ALLSTAR→HOPE-1→HOPE-2→HOPE-3). Found the full iteration history — indication pivot (MI→DMD), route change (intracoronary→IV), dose escalation (25M→150M), endpoint evolution (scar size→PUL 1.2→PUL v2.0+LVEF). Trauma recurrence: ALLSTAR failure class (wrong indication/route) did not recur. CRL is a different failure class (regulatory packaging). All three consolidate stages assessed as functional.

2. **Cache-B** (second): SEC filings perspective. CRL details, two-facility manufacturing risk, endpoint strategy evolution, $150M raise. Assessed Filter→Attend as "repaired after failure" — the key finding. Original BLA tried to skip from n=20 Phase 2 to approval; FDA rejected; HOPE-3 was the structural fix.

**Notable from other two agents (kept as audit trail):**
- Cache-A: biodistribution gap (no published evidence CDC exosomes reach skeletal muscle), p-value attenuated from HOPE-2 (0.014) to HOPE-3 (0.029) despite 5x patients
- Consolidate-B: READ stage impaired (management spin on HOPE-2 results), securities fraud class action, Shkreli's critique was primarily forward pass ("drug won't work") not backward pass

**Codex merge dispatched**: 2 independent instances merging top 2 into recursive SOAP notes with temporal snapshots.

### Codex SOAP merge complete

Both instances agree. Diagnosis: consolidate stack was functional and compounding across four snapshots. Shkreli diagnosed the forward pass at one snapshot; the framework diagnoses the backward pass trajectory. No merge disagreement — both produced the same assessment independently.

Key line from SOAP-B: "the framework would have been long the trajectory, not necessarily long the t₃ snapshot."

### CAPR Run 0 demonstration: complete

The framework would have predicted PASS on HOPE-3 because:
1. ALLSTAR failure was absorbed, not repeated (no trauma recurrence)
2. Each trial structurally rewrote the weak interfaces (indication, route, dose, endpoints, sample size)
3. The CRL was a different failure class (regulatory packaging, not mechanism)
4. The consolidate stack was functional at all three stages

This is structurally distinct from Shkreli's analysis, which was a forward-pass snapshot critique ("the drug won't work"). The framework adds the temporal dimension he missed.

## 2026-03-20: CAPR smoke test declared, stashing for redo

### Correction
The CAPR run was dispatched with the static-tree framing (pre-temporal-network insight). The agents produced useful evidence but the search prompts, report structure, and SOAP merge all used the old model. The data is good; the framing is wrong.

**Decision**: Declare the CAPR run a smoke test (not Run 0 demonstration). Stash the reports, delete intermediate artifacts from the main tree, and redo with temporal graph framing baked into the agent prompts from the start.

**What the smoke test validated:**
- The 4-agent search protocol works mechanically (all 4 returned, reasonable quality)
- Top-2 selection is feasible (clear quality gradient)
- Codex merge produces coherent SOAP notes
- Both merge instances agreed (good sign for the soap-a default rule)
- The temporal trajectory insight emerged even from static-framed agents (Consolidate-A naturally found the 4-snapshot sequence)

**What the smoke test exposed:**
- Agents need the temporal schema in their prompts — they should be explicitly asked to produce pipe_state records per snapshot, not static handoff assessments
- The top-2 summary file was necessary because raw agent transcripts are too large for codex input (~1.4MB combined)
- Codex merge prompt needs to reference the snapshot/pipe_state data model explicitly

### Stash plan
- Move `searches/CAPR/` and `notes/CAPR/` to `smoke-test/CAPR/`
- Keep the raw data for reference
- Delete `top2-summary.md` (intermediate artifact)
- Update prereg to acknowledge the smoke test and corrections

### Tooling rebuilt for temporal schema

1. **init_db.py**: Seeds CAPR pipe topology (7 nodes: root + 4 cache handoffs + 3 consolidate stages) and 4 temporal snapshots (ALLSTAR, HOPE-1, HOPE-2/BLA, HOPE-3). Pipe_state records are empty — agents fill them.

2. **diagnose.py**: New commands:
   - `temporal TICKER` — prints pipe × snapshot grid with status markers
   - `trajectory TICKER` — shows only pipes that changed status across snapshots (the interesting ones)
   - `scorecard` — unchanged

3. **Prompts committed** (`prompts/` dir):
   - `cache-agent.md` — forward pass agent. Outputs PIPE_STATE records per handoff per snapshot.
   - `consolidate-agent.md` — backward pass agent. Outputs PIPE_STATE records per stage per snapshot, plus TRAUMA_CHECK.
   - `merge-agent.md` — SOAP merge agent. Produces temporal graph table + SOAP note with prediction template.

All prompts require structured output (pipe_state records), not prose. This is the correction from the smoke test — agents must produce temporal graph data, not static assessments.

## 2026-03-20: Falsifiability tightening (codex sniff test #4)

Codex reviewed temporal schema + prompts. Verdict: "good conceptual sketch, weak contract." Seven issues, all about the gap between what prompts produce and what the schema stores.

### Fixes applied

1. **Prediction polarity**: added `direction` (pass/fail) and `resolution_source` to prediction table. The DB record is the falsifiable artifact, not the SOAP note.

2. **Pipe identity**: added `UNIQUE(company_id, stack, site)` constraint. No more fuzzy string matching.

3. **Snapshot bounds**: replaced single `timestamp` with `date_start`/`date_end`. Added `UNIQUE(company_id, label)`.

4. **Run 0 catalyst definition**: added CAPR to the prereg appendix with exact catalyst, source, window, and PASS condition (same format as Run 1).

5. **Falsifiability contract**: added to prereg. DB record is the prediction. SOAP notes are disposable. Resolution is mechanical: check source on window_end, apply pass_condition, no judgment.

6. **Trajectory categories**: added `category` field to prediction — living_well, living_dying, dying_pivoted, dying_dying. Maps to direction (pass/fail) but gives more insight into why. CAPR would be dying_pivoted → pass.

### Not fixed yet (acknowledged, acceptable for pilot)

- `pipe_state_source` join table (multi-source provenance) — agents will stuff multiple URLs into evidence text. Good enough for pilot.
- `trauma_check` table — recurrence judgment stays in the consolidate agent's output file. Not in DB.
- `diagnosis` table for SOAP artifacts — SOAP notes stay as files, not DB records. Declared disposable in prereg.
- `confidence` field on pipe_state — "functional but untested" gets mapped to nearest enum value. Noted in agent prompts.

## 2026-03-20: ATYR catalyst hardened

Codex sniff test #4 flagged ATYR as not falsifiable — "FDA confirms a viable regulatory path" requires judgment. Researched the timing chain: Type C meeting mid-April → FDA minutes within 30 days → 8-K within 4 business days.

Replaced with B1: "aTyr announces intent to initiate a new sarcoidosis trial." This is binary (announced or not), tests the consolidate stack specifically (Read FDA feedback → Process → Write new trial), and has a clean window (by 2026-09-30).

B2 (actual ClinicalTrials.gov registration) was considered but tests execution, not learning. We want to test the learning loop.

## 2026-03-20: Codex bounce rounds #5-7

Bounced back and forth with codex until no major blockers remained.

**Round 5** (4 blockers):
1. diagnose.py snapshot API still used `timestamp` instead of `date_start`/`date_end` — fixed
2. ATYR still had "with FDA alignment" — removed
3. QURE was TBD — researched and locked (AMT-130 topline, outcome known Sep 2025, FDA subsequently pushed back Jan 2026)
4. prereg referenced `diagnose.py tree TICKER` but CLI only has `temporal`/`trajectory`/`scorecard` — fixed

**Round 6** (2 blockers):
1. diagnose.py `add_snapshot()` still wrote `timestamp` column — fixed to `date_start`/`date_end`
2. prereg prediction template was old format (Company/Catalyst/Source/Window/Prediction/Reasoning) — updated to match all DB fields (type, category, direction, resolution_source, window_start, window_end, pass_condition, reasoning)

**Round 7** (3 blockers):
1. `published_at` nullable, no way to prove record existed before catalyst — fixed: `add_prediction()` now auto-sets `published_at = datetime('now')` on insert
2. Scorecard admitted unpublished predictions — fixed: scorecard view now filters `WHERE published_at IS NOT NULL`
3. `analyst_call` allowed multiple rows per prediction — fixed: added `UNIQUE(prediction_id)`, changed `position` to `direction` (pass/fail enum), matches prediction schema

After round 7, codex had no remaining blockers.

## 2026-03-20: Peters' framework — what it does for us

Researched Joseph Peters' sequence-based dynamic graphs (Theory of Computing Systems, 2019). Key insight: the framework provides two operations on a graph sequence G₁, G₂, ..., Gδ:

- **Composition**: combine adjacent snapshots into a compound view
- **Test**: check if a property holds on the compound

Slide the window, repeat. Different test operations on the same sequence yield different "stories" — same data, multiple perspectives and arcs.

**What this gives us:**
- Same snapshot sequence, different test operations → different arcs (cache stack test vs. consolidate stack test)
- T-interval connectivity with different T → different arc lengths (local learning vs. strategic coherence)
- Amortized Θ(1) per new snapshot → ongoing monitoring is cheap (compose new snapshot with running compound, test, done)
- The pledge/turn/prestige arc structure maps directly: initial state → break → repair trajectory. The framework formalizes *why* the prestige was earned.

**The core contribution to our project**: not just "temporal graphs exist" but that you can compute trajectory properties in constant time per new event, and ask different questions of the same sequence by swapping the test. Formalized storytelling.

### Status summary (end of session)

**Done:**
- Design doc, biotech pilot, prereg (7 rounds of codex review)
- Temporal schema (pipes, snapshots, pipe_states, predictions, analyst_calls)
- Agent prompts (cache, consolidate, merge) requiring PIPE_STATE records
- All scripts match schema, all constraints enforced
- CAPR smoke test completed and stashed (validated pipeline mechanics)
- All 5 company catalysts locked (CAPR, QURE for Run 0; SPRB, ATYR, INMB for Run 1)
- Falsifiability contract: DB record is the prediction, resolution is mechanical, SOAP is disposable
- Public repo: github.com/kimjune01/universal-diagnosis

## 2026-03-20: Event-based temporal graph (drop snapshots)

Snapshots were pre-defined eras — a narrative lever. Replaced with events: each event is a public record with an archival date. The temporal graph grows one event at a time. No pre-seeded eras, no agent discretion on boundaries.

**Changes:**
- schema.sql: dropped `snapshot` and `pipe_state` tables, added `event` table (pipe_id, source_date, status, evidence, source_url)
- diagnose.py: `timeline TICKER` (event stream per pipe), `transitions TICKER` (status changes only)
- Agent prompts: output EVENT records with archival dates, not PIPE_STATE per snapshot
- Merge prompt: event timeline table instead of snapshot grid
- init_db.py: no snapshot seeding, events start empty

Peters' framework still applies: composition = combine consecutive events, test = check property on compound. But the events are grounded in archival dates of public records, not in researcher-defined eras.

## 2026-03-20: CAPR Run 0 (event-based) complete

### Results
Both codex merges agree: **Category: dying_pivoted, Direction: PASS.**

Same conclusion as smoke test, but the event-based framing produced:
- ~60 dated events (vs. ~4 static snapshots in smoke test)
- Archival dates from source documents (vs. estimated era labels)
- Explicit trauma recurrence disagreement surfaced (Consol-A: no, Consol-B: yes)
- New evidence not found in smoke test: CADUCEUS 2012, Xie integrin 2014, DSMB futility pass 2023, Vinay Prasad angle, pre-BLA CMC meeting 2024

### Delta from smoke test
The temporal framing added granularity but not a different conclusion. The dying_pivoted trajectory is the same story told with more resolution. The key value-add: the trauma recurrence disagreement. Static framing said "no recurrence" uniformly. Event-based framing revealed a legitimate split — the management spin gap (CRL + securities fraud) could be read as same-class recurrence of overconfident interpretation, even though the scientific failure classes are different.

This is exactly what Peters' framework enables: same node set, different test operations yield different stories. The test "did the same scientific failure recur?" says no. The test "did the same communication failure recur?" says yes. Both are valid. The merge surfaces both.

### Prediction record (per protocol, soap-a is primary)
- Company: CAPR
- Type: Run 0 retrospective
- Category: dying_pivoted
- Direction: PASS
- Catalyst: HOPE-3 Phase 3 topline readout
- Resolution source: Capricor press release / SEC 8-K (2025-12-03)
- Window: 2025-10-01 to 2025-12-31
- Pass condition: PUL v2.0 total score statistically significant
- Outcome: HIT (known)

## 2026-03-20: Speculative territory (not in prereg)

### Observation: read_outcomes recurrence → vol arbitrage

The CAPR event-based diagnosis surfaced a disagreement on trauma recurrence. Consolidate-A says no (different scientific failure classes). Consolidate-B says yes (same communication failure class — management overreads ambiguous data, FDA disagrees, management acts surprised).

The communication recurrence is a pattern:
1. Data comes in ambiguous
2. Management reads it as unambiguously positive
3. Regulator disagrees
4. Management acts surprised

This happened with HOPE-2 → CRL. The read_outcomes pipe was never repaired — only write_substrate was fixed (they ran a proper trial). The interpretation habit persists.

### Implication: the framework predicts vol mispricing

If management systematically overframes, then:
- Market expectations are inflated by management's narrative (IV calibrated to management's framing)
- Any ambiguous outcome produces a larger surprise than the market expects
- Realized vol > implied vol around catalyst dates

This is not a directional prediction (PASS/FAIL). It's a prediction about the *gap between expectation and reality* — which is what vol prices.

### Testable hypothesis (future work, not this pilot)

"Companies with broken read_outcomes pipes (recurring management overframing) have higher realized-to-implied vol ratios around catalyst dates than companies with functional read_outcomes pipes."

This is falsifiable across a portfolio using historical options data. CAPR data points:
- CRL (Jul 2025): management said "no deficiencies" at mid-cycle. Stock cratered. Check realized vs implied.
- HOPE-3 (Dec 2025): management said it would work. It did. Stock +440%. Check realized vs implied.
- Shkreli short (Nov 2025): stock -17% on a tweet. Was that priced in?

### Secondary prediction candidate (CAPR PDUFA Aug 22 2026)

"If the August 22 PDUFA results in anything other than clean approval, Capricor's press release will frame it more favorably than the FDA's actual letter."

Falsifiable, binary, mechanically scorable (compare press release to FDA letter). But conditional — void if clean approval. Not added to prereg for this pilot. Logged for potential Run 2.

### Why this matters for the framework

The framework's value-add isn't just PASS/FAIL on catalysts. It's diagnosing *which pipe is broken* and predicting the consequences of the specific break. A broken read_outcomes pipe doesn't mean the drug fails — it means the company's self-assessment is unreliable, which makes the market's information about the company's information wrong. That's a second-order prediction no analyst framework produces.

## 2026-03-20: QURE Run 0 complete

### Results
Both codex merges agree: **Category: dying_dying.**

QURE is the mirror image of CAPR:
- **CAPR**: forward pass broken → company learned → repaired → dying_pivoted → PASS
- **QURE**: forward pass functional → company didn't learn → broke further → dying_dying → FAIL (on regulatory path)

The drug works (75% slowing on cUHDRS, p=0.003). The company's consolidate stack is broken:
- **read_outcomes**: recurring failure. Management overread FDA alignment (Dec 2024), didn't detect the shift (Nov 2025), then fought the feedback instead of pivoting. FDA eventually went public calling the data "distorted" and "manipulated" (Mar 2026).
- **batch_process**: mixed. Some real scientific work (CHDI propensity score paper). But management's primary response was arguing FDA inconsistency and raising ethical objections to sham trials — defending the methodology rather than rewriting it.
- **write_substrate**: stressed. $622.5M cash (runway to 2029) but no Phase 3 registered. Manufacturing divested. Securities fraud class actions filed.

### Trauma recurrence
All agents found same_class: yes. The recurrence goes deeper than Nov 2025 → Mar 2026. Consolidate-A found the root: FDA's October 2022 guidance explicitly said "we generally do not encourage external controls." uniQure built their entire BLA strategy on external controls anyway. Three years of ignoring published rules.

### Prediction record
- Company: QURE
- Type: recurrence (read_outcomes overframing pattern)
- Category: dying_dying
- Direction: PASS on topline (drug worked), FAIL on regulatory path (BLA blocked)
- Catalyst: AMT-130 Phase I/II topline readout
- Resolution source: uniQure press release (Sep 24 2025)
- Window: 2025-08-01 to 2025-10-31
- Pass condition: cUHDRS statistically significant
- Outcome: HIT on topline (p=0.003). But the framework would have predicted the regulatory collapse that followed — the consolidate stack was already broken.

### CAPR vs QURE: the framework's value-add
Both companies had positive topline data. The difference is the consolidate stack:
- CAPR: functional. Read the CRL, processed it, wrote a proper Phase 3. Outcome: approval path restored.
- QURE: broken. Read the FDA reversal, fought it, relationship collapsed. Outcome: stock -84%, class actions, "lied" in headlines.

A snapshot analyst sees two companies with positive data. The framework sees one with a functional learning loop and one without. That's the structural distinction the prereg asks for.

### Shkreli comparison
Shkreli was long QURE (correct on the drug, wrong on the company). He sold Nov 2025 before the break — but for unrelated reasons, not because he diagnosed the consolidate stack. The framework would have flagged the risk earlier: the external control methodology was always the vulnerability, and the FDA's 2022 guidance was the first event.

## 2026-03-20: Run 1 — SPRB in progress

### Agents returning (3 of 4 back)

**Consolidate-B**: Spruce's backstory is wild. Tildacerfont failed twice (Mar 2024, Dec 2024), company cut 55% staff, faced Nasdaq delisting, then acquired TA-ERT from BioMarin (via bankrupt Allievex) in April 2025. Going-concern flagged. Trauma recurrence: same_class no (clinical failure vs. manufacturing timeline). Shkreli long, targets $500.

**Cache-A**: The molecule is mature — 7+ years of clinical data under BioMarin/Allievex, 22 patients treated, CSF HS-NRE normalization sustained at 240 weeks, cognitive scores 34.66 points above untreated (p<0.0001). Forward pass is strong. ICV delivery route carries surgical risk (14% hydrocephalus discontinuation). BTD granted.

**Cache-B**: Going concern in 10-K, $48.9M cash, remaining $35M loan tranches are milestone-gated. PPQ batch requirement pushed BLA from Q1 to Q4 2026. Company is single-asset after tildacerfont died. CDMO-dependent for manufacturing. Any PPQ slip = cash crisis before BLA. Also: Allievex went bankrupt trying to bring this same molecule to market — potential meta-level trauma recurrence.

### Key tension
The molecule's forward pass is rock solid (science done, FDA aligned on surrogate). The company's consolidate stack is fragile (going concern, tight cash, execution-dependent). The prediction is about execution, not science.

### Speculative notes (not in prereg)

**Insider trading as read_outcomes signal**: SEC Form 4 filings are dated public records. Insider buy/sell behavior before 8-K disclosures could be added as events in the temporal graph. If insiders are selling before bad news, read_outcomes is functioning privately while public framing is spin. The divergence between insider behavior and management narrative is itself diagnostic. Future extension — not this pilot.

**Meta-level trauma recurrence**: Allievex went bankrupt bringing TA-ERT to market. Spruce is now attempting the same thing with the same molecule. Is "company dies trying to commercialize this specific drug" a recurring failure class? Different companies, same molecule, same bottleneck (manufacturing/CMC/capital). This is the pipe's consolidate stack failing, not just one company's. Worth tracking but hard to formalize — the pipe topology assumes a single company as the consolidate stack.

## 2026-03-20: SPRB Run 1 — first real prediction

### Agent results
- Cache-A: molecule history (BioMarin/Allievex), 7yr data, 22 patients, ICV delivery, strong forward pass
- Cache-B: SEC filings, PPQ delay, going concern, single-asset, financial fragility
- Consolidate-A: blocked by data sources (FDA/ClinicalTrials.gov API failures), only 1 event
- Consolidate-B: full pivot narrative, tildacerfont failures, BTD, Shkreli timing, trauma check

### Merge disagreement
SOAP-A: dying_pivoted, **PASS** — FDA alignment is strong, company is executing despite fragility
SOAP-B: dying_pivoted, **FAIL** — meta-level trauma recurrence (molecule has outlived two prior consolidate stacks), cash fragility, PPQ execution risk

Per protocol: **soap-a is primary (PASS).** Both published.

### Prediction record (SPRB — first real prospective prediction)
- Company: SPRB
- Type: fix (molecule is proven, company is the new consolidate stack)
- Category: dying_pivoted
- Direction: PASS
- Catalyst: BLA submission for TA-ERT
- Resolution source: Spruce Biosciences press release or SEC 8-K
- Window start: 2026-10-01
- Window end: 2026-12-31
- Pass condition: BLA submitted to FDA and acknowledged
- Reasoning: Company pivoted from dead tildacerfont program, acquired a mature molecule with BTD/RMAT/Orphan/Fast Track/Rare Pediatric designations, FDA confirmed accelerated approval path with CSF HS-NRE as surrogate. Consolidate stack is fragile (going concern, single-asset) but functional — reading FDA feedback, adapting to PPQ requirements, hiring commercial leadership. The molecule's forward pass doesn't need more learning. The question is execution, and the trajectory shows a company that is executing despite stress.

### Risk the framework surfaces that Shkreli misses
Shkreli says "will be approved" — that's a forward pass call. The framework says the forward pass is solid but the consolidate stack is fragile. The risk isn't the drug, it's the cash. A PPQ batch slip → cash crisis → BLA delayed past the window → FAIL. Shkreli's $500 target assumes execution. The framework predicts PASS but flags the execution fragility.

### Meta-level trauma recurrence (noted but not scored)
The molecule has outlived BioMarin (deprioritized) and Allievex (bankrupt). The recurring failure class isn't scientific — it's "company dies trying to commercialize this specific drug." Spruce is attempt #3. This is a pipe-level trauma recurrence that the company-level analysis doesn't capture. Worth tracking.

## 2026-03-20: ATYR Run 1 — second prospective prediction

### Agent results
All four returned strong data. Key findings:
- filter_attend is broken (Phase 3 primary miss) but the endpoint was wrong, not the drug
- read_outcomes is functional — management acknowledged the miss honestly, presented secondaries at ERS
- write_substrate is pending — no new trial registered, FDA Type C meeting mid-April is the gating event
- Cash $80.9M, ~4Q runway, but new Phase 3 would need dilution at $0.85/share
- Shkreli shorted, predicted 80% crash — which happened, but for endpoint reasons not drug reasons

### Merge disagreement (second time)
SOAP-A: dying_pivoted, **PASS** — asset concentration pushes announcement, FDA meeting + 5 months is enough time
SOAP-B: dying_pivoted, **FAIL** — Type C necessary but not sufficient, fast alignment unlikely

Per protocol: **soap-a is primary (PASS).**

### Prediction record (ATYR)
- Company: ATYR
- Type: fix (endpoint pivot from steroid dose to QoL)
- Category: dying_pivoted
- Direction: PASS
- Catalyst: aTyr announces a new sarcoidosis clinical trial (any phase, any design)
- Resolution source: aTyr Pharma press release or SEC 8-K
- Window start: 2026-04-01
- Window end: 2026-09-30
- Pass condition: Press release or 8-K announcing a new sarcoidosis clinical trial
- Reasoning: Consolidate stack is functional at read_outcomes (honest reading, ERS presentation) and batch_process (FDA engagement, no panic pivot). Write_substrate pending FDA Type C meeting mid-April. If FDA provides even moderately constructive feedback, asset concentration and incentive alignment push the company to announce a new trial. Timeline: Type C April → minutes May → announcement June-August → within window.

### Framework vs Shkreli
Shkreli: short, "really bad drug" — forward pass critique
Framework: drug works on QoL endpoints, endpoint choice was wrong (filter_attend broken), consolidate stack is functional enough to pivot. Predicts PASS on new trial announcement — company will learn from the miss and iterate.

This is the inverse of QURE: both had Phase 3 issues with the FDA. QURE fought the feedback (read_outcomes broken → dying_dying). ATYR is engaging constructively (read_outcomes functional → dying_pivoted). The framework predicts different outcomes for the same superficial situation based on consolidate stack health.

## 2026-03-20: INMB Run 1 — third prospective prediction

### Agent results
- Cache-A: MissionEB Phase 3 primary MISSED (EBDASI p=0.15, favoured placebo by 3.75 points). Secondary signals in itch, pain, weight gain. Effect transient (peaks 56-112 days).
- Cache-B: Going concern Q3 10-Q, $27.7M cash, CEO transition mid-crisis, three dilutions in 15 months, BMF ghost consultant allegations unaddressed, XPro $16.5M impairment.
- Consolidate-A: BLA slipped 12 months (2025→late 2026), MHRA pre-submission filed Feb 2026, manufacturing runs complete, FDA aligned on XPro Phase 2b/3.
- Consolidate-B: Read_outcomes functional (honest framing, peer venue presentations), write_substrate functional (MHRA package, manufacturing, FDA alignment), but pattern of post-failure reframing.

### Both merges agree: dying_pivoted, FAIL
First unanimous merge. Both codex instances independently concluded: the temporal pattern of repeated primary misses, timeline slippage, going-concern pressure, and post-failure reframing makes a clean MAA submission unlikely by September 30.

### Prediction record (INMB)
- Company: INMB
- Type: recurrence (pattern: primary miss → secondary salvage → timeline slip)
- Category: dying_pivoted
- Direction: FAIL
- Catalyst: CORDStrom MAA submitted to UK MHRA and acknowledged
- Resolution source: INmune Bio press release or SEC 8-K
- Window start: 2026-06-01
- Window end: 2026-09-30
- Pass condition: MAA submitted and acknowledged by MHRA
- Reasoning: Two programs both missed primaries. Both pivoting to secondary/totality-of-evidence. BLA already slipped 12 months. Going concern with $27.7M cash. CEO transition mid-crisis. The temporal trajectory shows a company that iterates post-failure narratives but slips execution timelines. MHRA pre-submission filed (real forward motion) but the pattern predicts another delay.

### Framework vs Shkreli
Shkreli: "90% drop" — most extreme call, generic bearish. Stock dropped ~60% on XPro miss but has partially recovered.
Framework: agrees with bear direction for different reasons. Not "bad drug" but "bad pattern" — the consolidate stack rewrites narratives faster than it ships filings. The prediction isn't stock price collapse, it's specific: MAA won't be submitted on time.

### Pattern across all five companies

| Company | Category | Direction | Merges agree? | Shkreli |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| CAPR | dying_pivoted | PASS | Yes | Bear (wrong) |
| QURE | dying_dying | FAIL | Yes | Bull (right to sell, wrong reason) |
| SPRB | dying_pivoted | PASS | No (soap-a) | Bull |
| ATYR | dying_pivoted | PASS | No (soap-a) | Bear |
| INMB | dying_pivoted | FAIL | Yes | Bear |

Three PASS, two FAIL. Four dying_pivoted, one dying_dying. Three unanimous, two split. The framework disagrees with Shkreli on CAPR (framework right retrospectively) and ATYR (TBD).

**Run 1 complete. All three predictions on the record.**
